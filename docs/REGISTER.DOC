                         How to Register The Online Pub

    Information
    -----------

    After a reasonable evaluation period, you are required to either stop using
TOP, or register (pay for) it.  This file with help you decide which type of
registration you need, along with provide you with reasons for registration.

    The Online Pub is a shareware program.  Shareware programs allow you try
them before you purchase them.  Unlike many shareware programs, TOP has no
features removed from the shareware version - you get to evaluate all of TOP's
features at their fullest potential.  It is hoped that this approach will
encourage you to register more than offering bonus features would, because you
get to try out all of the features which makes TOP so powerful.  After all,
when you test-drive a car, you don't get to test a car with no power steering,
no radio, and no cruise control.  You get all of the features so you can really
determine if that car suits you.  This is the approach taken with TOP.

    Registration has several benefits.  For one thing, it's illegal to use TOP
beyond the evaluation period (which is defined as 60 days in the licence
agreement, LICENCE.DOC), so you'll be doing the right thing.  Another benefit
is that it looks good to have a registered copy of a program running on your
BBS - users are often impressed by this.  More than that, though, you'll be
entitled to discounts or even free upgrades to future versions of TOP,
including possible non-shareware versions.  You'll also be eligible to
participate in the TOP beta program, which allows you to get involved in the
creation of TOP as well as try out the newest features as soon as they are
completed.  Finally, you'll receive guaranteed technical support for TOP.
Although I currently try to help as many people as I can with TOP, the time may
come when I am so loaded down with work that I am no longer able to do this.
Registration ensures that your problem will be dealt with as soon as possible.

    TOP's registration fee may at first seem a little expensive, but consider
what you are getting.  For one thing, you'll be getting a program that
instantly makes your BBS more popular.  If you're running a pay BBS, that
translates into more money!  Even if you don't run your BBS for profit, your
users may have such a good time in TOP that they will send you donations!
Secondly, TOP is no more expensive than some other chat doors on the market,
and gives you tons more features.  You could buy a cheaper chat door, of
course. But, while these programs can be good, they don't offer nearly half of
the features that TOP does.  Similarly priced chat programs offer lots of
features, but usually have a restriction on the number of nodes you can have,
or actions you can have.  TOP does not have needless limitations.  Plus,
consider your other alternatives - Major BBS is nice, but it's hideously
expensive.  Most other multinode systems are too.  TOP offers all of the
features of these systems and more at 1/10th of the price or less.

    There are two levels of TOP registration:  Commercial and Non-commercial.
Each of these levels is described below.  There are also three upgrade options
available for TOP - two for previously registered users of The RemoteAccess Pub
v1.8x, TOP's ancestor, and one for Non-commercially registered TOP users
wishing to move to a Commercial registration.  These are also described below.

    NOTE:  Be sure to read the important information that follows the
registration and upgrade options!

    New Registrations
    -----------------

    Commercial registration allows you to use TOP on a BBS being run for profit
or other commercial purposes, or on a system run from government, educational,
or commercial property.  It is the highest level of TOP registration, and as
such is the most expensive.  The current price for Commercial registration is
$65CDN in Canada, $65US elsewhere.

    Non-commercial registration can only be used by home-based BBSs that are
not being run with commercial interests in mind.  These are also known as
"hobby BBSs".  The author of TOP encourages the development and operation of
hobby BBSs, the _original_ BBSs, and as such wants to help out anybody with the
courage to run a multi-node BBS out of their own pocketbook.  The current price
for Non-commercial registration is $30 (CDN funds in Canada, US funds
elsewhere).

    GROUP REGISTRATION DISCOUNT OFFER:  Have several sysops in your area been
turned on to TOP?  If so, get them together to be elegible for TOP's group
discount!  By registering as a group, you can take 5 percent times the number
of copies being registered (up to a maximum of 30%) off of your registration
fee!  You can combine Commercial and Non-commercial registrations.  Upgrades
are not eligible.  To qualify, each person registering must fill out their own
copy of REGISTER.FRM, and all of the registration forms and payments must be
mailed in the same envelope.  It it preferred that one cheque or money order
for the entire sum (all copies, including applicable service charges) be
included, but multiple cheques/money orders may be included if it is more
convenient, as long as they are all in the same envelope.  Offer applies on
orders of two or more copies only.  Here is a chart to help you compute the
price-per-copy:

              Discount              Commercial            Non-commercial

2 copies  @   10% off   each costs  $58.50 (save $ 6.50)  $27.00 (save $3.00)
3 copies  @   15% off   each costs  $55.25 (save $ 9.75)  $25.50 (save $4.50)
4 copies  @   20% off   each costs  $52.00 (save $13.00)  $24.00 (save $6.00)
5 copies  @   25% off   each costs  $48.75 (save $16.25)  $22.50 (save $7.50)
6 or more @   30% off   each costs  $45.50 (save $19.50)  $21.00 (save $9.00)

    To register TOP, print out the file REGISTER.FRM, included with TOP, fill
it out, and mail it with your cheque or money order to the address given later
in this file.

    Upgrade Options
    ---------------

    Registered users of The RemoteAccess Pub (RAP) 1.8x can upgrade to a
Commercial registration for only $10 (CDN funds in Canada, US funds elsewhere).
Counting the $20 you paid for RAP, this brings the total cost for a Commercial
registration to only $30, a steal of a deal!  The author told you that you
would be rewarded for registering early, but you didn't believe him, did you?

    Registered users of RAP can upgrade to a Non-commercial registration for
FREE!  All you have to do is send in the registration and you'll receive your
new key at no charge.  NOW do you believe the author?

    Non-commercially registered users of TOP wishing to upgrade to a Commercial
registration can do so by simply paying the difference, currently $35.  Group
discount rates do not apply to upgrades, but those who registered using a group
discount do NOT have to pay the discounted amount to make up the difference.
For example, if you paid $24 for your Non-commercial registration as part of a
4-copy group purchase, you still only need to pay $35 to upgrade, not $41.

    To receive your upgraded key, print out the file UPGRADE.FRM, included with
TOP, fill it out, and mail it to the address given later in this file.

    Key Loss and Replacement
    ------------------------

    Should you lose your TOP key due to data corruption, natural disaster, or
other unfortunate circumstances, a replacement key can be obtained by
contacting the author using one of the methods listed at the end of this file.
Usually, replacement keys can be obtained for the price of a phone call, though
this is not guaranteed.

    You must be prepared to give evidence of your identity.  Any information
that you provided on your TOP registration form would help you here, especially
uncommon information, such as what payment method you used, what delivery
method you used, responses to the survey on the registration form, past
communication with the author, etc.

    Replacement keys are issued at the author's discretion.  The author will
try to confirm your identity as best he can with the information provided, but
if you cannot prove your identity sufficiently to the author's satisfaction,
then you will not receive a replacement key.  You will also be refused a
replacement key if you are known to have broken any of the conditions in
LICENCE.DOC.

    NOTE:  Theft of keys is treated on a case-by-case basis.  The registered
user's licence, described in LICENCE.DOC, lists careless action by the key
holder as an irresponsible act, which violates the licence agreement.  For
example, if you leave your only backup disk unprotected, and somebody visits
your house and steals the disk, YOU would be at fault!  You may be required to
prove that the theft could not have been avoided, and that you cannot be held
responsible for the loss of your key.

    PLEASE MAKE BACKUPS!  Backups of keys are permitted subject to the
conditions in LICENCE.DOC.  These conditions are quite lenient, so there should
be no excuse for losing your key!

    Service Charges
    ---------------

    Depending on how you want your key delivered and where you are registering
from, there may be a small service charge or two on some aspects of the
registration, as described below.

    People registering TOP from outside Canada and the US must pay a $3US fee
to cover additional postage/phone charges incurred when delivering the key.
This does not apply if you plan to call the ISMWare Support BBS to download
your key.

    If you wish your key sent on a Floppy Disk, you need to include a $3
service charge (CDN funds in Canada, US funds elsewhere).  This covers the cost
of the disk, the disk mailer, and the extra postage.  As a small bonus, on the
floppy disk (space allowing) you'll receive an authentic copy of the latest
version of TOP on the disk, to be sure that you're up-to-date and not missing
any files.  You may also receive other ISMWare products on the disk to try, or
even beta versions of TOP, depending on when you register.

    Payment Methods
    ---------------

    Canadian residents get a slight discount (specifcally the US exchange rate)
because TOP is a Canadian-made program, and it is easier for the author to
process Canadian funds and cheaper to send out Canadian registrations.
Canadian residents may pay the registration fee and all service charges in
Canadian dollars by either a Canadian Postal Money Order, Bank Money Order, or
personal cheque drawn on a Canadian bank.

    US residents must pay in US funds using a cheque drawn on a US bank, or a
Money Order or Bank Draft.

    Residents outside of Canada and the US must pay in US funds using an
International Money Order.

    The author apologizes, especially to overseas customers, that registration
by credit card is not currently available.  The author is looking into this,
but it takes time to set this up, so please bear with the inconvenience.

    How to Register
    ---------------

    Registration entitles you to use _one_ copy of TOP on _one_ BBS for as long
as you like.  You may not run two copies of TOP on the same key or give copies
of your key away to your friends.  Your will receive two registration keys, one
for DOS version of TOP, and one for the OS/2 version of TOP.  However, you can
only use one key or the other at one time.  See LICENCE.DOC for more details on
what you can and can't do.

    Your registration key will be generated from the real name and BBS name
given on the form.  It is not possible for registration keys to be issued to
handles.  However, it is understood some people like to run handles-only system
and protect their real names.  Because of this, TOP will show only the BBS name
and a serial number to users.  This allows the author to safely find illegal
keys while still giving you some privacy.  So, in short, please be sure to
include your real name even if you run a handles-only BBS.

    Once you have everything together and the form(s) filled out, mail them to
this address:

TOP Registration
c/o Paul Sidorsky
1414 45th Street SW
Calgary, Alberta
CANADA    T3C 2C2

    Your new key will be delivered to you within 2-6 weeks.  In practice, keys
usually don't take anywhere near six weeks to be delivered, but please allow
for the time in case problems arise.

    Users upgrading from RAP v1.8x to a Non-commercial registration ONLY may
send a completed copy of UPGRADE.FRM to the author electronically, as no
payment is required.  Here's how:

    - Send FidoNet Netmail to 1:134/31, addressed to ("Paul Sidorsky").  Please
include the registration form in the body of the message.  If this absolutely
isn't possible, rename the filled out UPGRADE.FRM file like this:  MMDDYY.III,
where MM is the month number, DD is the day number, YY is the year number, and
III is your initials and attach it to the netmail message.  Your key will be
crashmailed to your node.

    - Call the ISMWare Support BBS and press L at the Main Menu to leave
feedback.  Write a small note stating that you are upgrading to TOP and your
form is attached, and then save the message.  When asked "Send files with this
message?", answer Yes and upload the file.  The filename is not important and
can be whatever you like.

    You can also use one of the above methods to contact the author if you have
questions about registration or other aspects of TOP.
