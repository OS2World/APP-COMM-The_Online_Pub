The Online v2.00 - Licence Information
--------------------------------------

    NOTE TO FORMER RA PUB USERS:  This licence has changed from the RA Pub
licence.  Please read this new licence, as it supersedes the previous one.

included with RA Pub.

    This licence supersedes the licence for all previous versions of TOP.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

    THE ONLINE PUB (TOP) IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES.  THE USAGE OF
THIS SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  THE AUTHOR CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY
DATA DAMAGE, DATA LOSS, OR PERSONAL INJURY THAT OCCURS AS A DIRECT OR INDIRECT
RESULT OF USING TOP.

    Every attempt has been made to assure that TOP will work without error,
but, as is the nature of the computing world, unexpected results can happen.
You should be sure to test TOP in an isolated environment with non-critical
data before committing TOP to your system.  Always keep backups!

DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION
------------------------

    YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO DISTRIBUTE THE ONLINE PUB (TOP) FREELY AS LONG AS
NONE OF THE FILES CONTAINED IN THE DISTRIBUTION ARCHIVE(S) AND/OR UPGRADE
ARCHIVE(S) HAVE BEEN ADDED, DELETED, OR MODIFIED IN ANY WAY.

    The term "Distribution Archive" refers to the compressed file that contains
all of the files needed by TOP and anybody running it.  It is not permitted to
distribute these files seperately, with the exception of action list files
(.ACT files) and language file (.LNG files).  These files may be distributed
seperately according to the same terms outlined in this section.

    The term "Upgrade Archive" refers to the compressed file that contains all
of the files needed to upgrade from a previous version of TOP to this one.  The
same restrictions that apply to Distribution Archives apply to Upgrade
Archives.

    _UNDER_NO_CIRCUMSTANCES_ SHOULD TOP REGISTRATION KEYS BE DISTRIBUTED IN ANY
WAY!  DOING SO IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF YOUR LICENCE TO RUN AND DISTRIBUTE TOP!

    BBS Operators
    -------------

    BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM OPERATORS (SYSOPS) ARE GRANTED PERMISSION TO
DISTRIBUTE THE ONLINE PUB (TOP) PROVIDING THAT _ALL_ OF THE FOLLOWING
CONDITIONS ARE MET WITH:

(1) NO FILES MAY BE ADDED TO THE DISTRIBUTION OR UPGRADE ARCHIVE(S).  This
    includes BBS advertisements, "advice" notes, etc.  However, you are
    permitted to include an archive comment that advertises your BBS.  If your
    copy of TOP contains files OTHER than those listed in FILELIST.DOC, you
    must delete them before making TOP available for download.

(2) NO FILES MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OR UPGRADE ARCHIVE(S).  If
    your copy of TOP does not include ALL of the files listed in FILELIST.DOC,
    you should contact the author or one of the TOP support BBSs for a complete
    version.

(3) NONE OF THE FILES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OR UPGRADE ARCHIVE(S) MAY BE MODIFIED
    IN ANY WAY.  The sizes, dates, and times of the files MUST match the ones
    in the author's original Distribution or Upgrade Archive.  The content of
    the files in the TOP Distribution or Upgrade Archive must also not be
    altered.  If you suspect some of the files in your copy of TOP have been
    tampered with, contact the author to verify that your copy of TOP is
    legitimate.

(4) YOUR BBS IS NOT USED TO CONDUCT OR PROMOTE ILLEGAL ACTIVIES such as, but
    not limited to, software piracy, the distribution of "adult" material to
    under-age persons, the distribution of other illegal files, or for
    illegitimate or illegal business practices.  If your BBS is used by
    international callers, the laws of the country or countries where these
    caller(s) are located must also be respected.

(5) NO FEE IS LEVIED AGAINST YOUR USERS FOR THE PRIVILAGE OF DOWNLOADING TOP.
    You may charge normal connect time fees if applicable, but you must make
    sure that TOP is available to all users that have paid the basic membership
    fee for your BBS.

(6) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN REGISTRATION KEY(S) FOR TOP BE MADE AVAILABLE
    FOR DOWNLOAD.

    YOU ARE GRANTED PERMISSION TO CHANGE THE ARCHIVE FORMAT AND FILE NAME OF
THE DISTRIBUTION AND/OR UPGRADE ARCHIVE(S) PROVIDING THAT YOU MEET WITH _ALL_
OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:

(7) YOU DO NOT VIOLATE ANY OF THE CONDITIONS LISTED ABOVE IN DOING SO.

(8) YOU KEEP THE SAME BASE FILE NAME FOR THE TOP DISTRIBUTION ARCHIVE.  All
    Distribution Archives of TOP are named using the format TOPvxyy.zzz, where
    v refers to the operating system version of TOP (D for TOP for DOS, O for
    TOP for OS/2, W for Win95), x refers to the major version number of TOP
    (the number to the left of the period), yy refers to the minor version
    number of TOP (the number to the right of the period), and zzz refers to
    the compression type of the Distribution Archive (ARJ, RAR, ZIP, etc.).
    Beta and Gamma versions of TOP have the letter B or G, respectively,
    followed by a beta or gamma release number (for example, 1) instead of the
    minor version number. You are only permitted to change the zzz part of the
    Distribution Archive Name; the rest must stay the same.  This version of
    TOP is distributed by the author with the file names of TOPD200.ARJ,
    TOPO200.ARJ, and TOPW200.ARJ.

(9) YOU KEEP THE SAME BASE FILE NAME FOR THE TOP UPGRADE ARCHIVE.  All Upgrade
    Archives of TOP are named using the format TOPvUxyy.zzz , where v, x, yy,
    and zzz refer to the same components as described in condition (8).  U
    stands for Upgrade.  You are only permitted to change the zzz part of the
    Upgrade Archive Name; the rest must stay the same.  The upgrades to this
    version of TOP are distributed by the author with the file names of
    TOPDU200.ARJ, TOPOU200.ARJ, and TOPWU200.ARJ.

    CONTAINS _UNREGISTERED_SHAREWARE_ THAT REQUIRES A SEPERATE PAYMENT TO THE
    AUTHOR AFTER A TRIAL PERIOD.

    YOU ARE GRANTED THE RIGHT TO USE THE ONLINE PUB (TOP) FOR A MAXIMUM OF
SIXTY (60) DAYS SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS:

(1) THE SYSTEM(S) YOU ARE USING TOP ON ARE NOT USED FOR ANY ILLEGAL PURPOSES.

(2) AT THE END OF THE SIXTY (60) DAY TRIAL PERIOD, YOU _MUST_ REGISTER YOUR
    COPY OF TOP WITH THE AUTHOR IF YOU WISH TO CONTINUE USING TOP.  OTHERWISE,
    YOU MUST DELETE ALL WORKING COPIES OF TOP FROM YOUR SYSTEM(S).  You may
    continue to distribute unregistered copies of TOP for as long as you like

    you must either register or stop using it after the trial period has
    expired.  Registration information is given in the file REGISTER.DOC.

(3) YOU OR YOUR COMPANY MAY NOT PROFIT FROM ALLOWING PEOPLE TO USE TOP.  If you
    run a "pay" BBS, you may charge your standard membership fees so long as no
    additional fees are charged to use TOP.

(4) YOU MUST NOT VIOLATE ANY OF THE DISTRIBUTION CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

REGISTERED USER LICENCE
-----------------------

    Once you have completed your TOP Registration form and submitted it, along
with full payment, you will be issued a TOP Registration Key.  Possession of
this Registration Key qualifies you as a Registered User of TOP, subject to the
terms of this licence.

    You will actually receive two keys when you register, but because both keys
make up one registration, they are treated as a single key everywhere in this
document, except in this paragraph, which describes the differences in keys.
One key works with the DOS version of TOP, and one key works with the OS/2
version of TOP.  However, ONLY ONE KEY OR THE OTHER MAY BE IN USE AT ANY ONE
TIME!  You may not give out the key for the version you are not using or use it
on a second BBS that you may happen to be involved with.  Both keys are for
YOUR USE ONLY ON THE SYSTEM NAMED WHEN TOP WAS REGISTERED.  Both keys are also
each protected by the conditions described below.

    UPON RECEPTION OF YOUR ONLINE PUB (TOP) REGISTRATION KEY, YOU ARE PERMITTED
TO INSTALL THE REGISTERED VERSION OF TOP ON ONE (1) HARD DRIVE, PROVIDED YOU
COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED BELOW.  CONDITION NUMBERS (1), (3), AND
(4) AS DESCRIBED IN THE TRIAL PERIOD LICENCE AGREEMENT ALSO APPLY TO THIS
LICENCE.

    A "Registered Version of TOP" is defined as a copy of TOP.EXE, TOP2.EXE,
TOPW.EXE, or TOP86.EXE that has access to a valid TOP Registration Key.  When
this is the case, TOP will identify itself as a Registered Version of TOP upon
entering the program.

    If you run a multi-node BBS, then all of the lines that use the Registered
Version of TOP must share the same hard drive, and only one (1) hard drive may
contain your TOP registration key.  If you run a LAN, then only one server may
contain the TOP registration key.

    You are permitted to make as many backups of the registration keys as you
wish, provided that a) the backups are not given out in any way, b) the
backups are not being used in conjunction with other copies of TOP, and c) the
backups are protected as other personal artifacts are, i.e. they are not
carelessly left around for other people to steal or copy.

    DISTRIBUTION OF A TOP REGISTRATION KEY IN ANY WAY IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF
THIS LICENCE!

    Instructions on how to register TOP and thus qualify for this part of the
licence are given in the file REGISTER.DOC.
