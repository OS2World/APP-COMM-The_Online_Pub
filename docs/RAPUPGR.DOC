How to Upgrade RAP v1.82/v1.82a to TOP v2.00
--------------------------------------------

    This file describers how to upgrade The RemoteAccess Pub v1.82 or v1.82a to
The Online Pub v2.00.  Users upgrading from TOP v2.00g1 should obtain the
uprade package of TOP from the author's BBS instead.

    If you have not changed your action file, and do not want to keep your old
RAP user file, you can delete RAP completely and follow the new installation
instructions in TOP.DOC.

    It is important that you follow EACH instruction in order to complete the
upgrade successully!  NOTE:  If you are planning to use the OS/2 version of
TOP, these instructions still apply!  The OS/2 version is completely compatible
with the DOS version, so you can still use your old files!

    1) Backup RAP.KEY (if you're registered), USERS.RAP and ACTIONS.RAP.  Make
sure you've got an archived copy of RAP 1.82/1.82a around, just in case the
gamma proves problematic.

    2) Delete NODE????.RAP, MIDX???.RAP, and CHGIDX.RAP from your RAP Work
Path.  You can run DELTEMP.BAT from RAP 1.82/1.82a to do this.

*** At this point you are advised to DELETE your RAP directory, create a new
TOP directory, and unpack the beta version into this directory.  A lot of files
used by RAP have either been renamed for TOP, or are unused altogether.  Thus,
your directory for RAP may get rather cluttered.  Furthermore, making a new
directly will help to prevent confusion as to which files belong to which
version (RAP or TOP).  After reunpacking the archive, move onto the next step.

    3) Copy the backups that you made in step 1 back to the TOP directory.  Be
sure to keep the backups around in case problems arise.  Then rename USERS.RAP
to USERS.TOP.  Also, if you are registered and have a RAP.KEY file, rename it
to TOP.KEY.

    4) Edit the included file TOP.CFG (yes, there finally is a configuration
file!) to suit your own setup.  TOP.CFG is a plain ASCII file, and is fully
"comment-documented".  You should make a backup of TOP.CFG and keep it around
in case you make a mistake or want to refer back to it.

    5) Edit the included file NODES.CFG to suit your node setup.  Like TOP.CFG,
NODES.CFG is a plain ASCII file and is self-documented with comments.  You
should also keep a backup of NODES.CFG around in case you ever need one.

    6) From the same directory as USERS.TOP, run 2G1TO200.EXE.  This program
will search for any personal actions which do not have the %m token in their
singular and plural text and insert it at the front of the action, as well as
change the action response to inform the user the action has been altered.  The
requirement of the %m token is necessary because without %m, users can use
personal actions to perform rather mean and nasty tricks on other users (eg.
impersonation, fake system messages, etc.)  This requirement is hardcoded into
TOP as well.

    7) Create a subdirectory for the *.ASC, *.ANS, and *.AVT files to be kept
in.  This is not required, but it keeps the TOP directory cleaner.  Next,
unpack ALLANSI.ARJ into this directory.  Finally, be sure to update the
TOPANSIPath setting in TOP.CFG so it uses the directory created in this step.

    8) To upgrade your action file, type the following command into DOS:

COPY __ACTHDR.TXT + ACTIONS.RAP MAIN.ACT

    This will prefix your old action file (ACTIONS.RAP) with some new
information that is required by TOP.  It will also rename the file to the
proper convention.  The new file should look exactly like your old ACTIONS.RAP
file with five new lines of information at the top, and no blank lines anywhere
in the file.  After verifiying that MAIN.ACT was copied successfully, you
can delete ACTIONS.RAP.  To complete the upgrade, enter this command into DOS:

TOPACT MAIN

    This will compile your new action file so that TOP can use it.  If TOPACT
reports that the file did not compile successfully, retry this step.  If you
still have problems, then review the section on "Actions" in TOP.DOC and see if
you can correct the problem.  If that doesn't work, edit the "ActionFiles"
setting in TOP.CFG so that no files are listed, and contact the author at your
earliest opportunity.

    9) If you wish, you can edit the files CHANNELS.CFG, BIOQUES.CFG, and
CENSOR.CFG to your needs, although changing these files is not required to
complete the upgrade.  These files are all ASCII files and comment-documented
like TOP.CFG is.  If you edit these files, keep a backup of the originals!

   10) Edit your existing BBS batch files to reflect these changes:
        a) the new TOP directory instead of the old RAP one.
        b) the TOP.EXE command line, which now only takes the node as a
           parameter. If your system has a TASK environment variable that
           contains the node number in decimal format, then you don't need the
           node number on the command line (though it's recommended you put it
           there anyhow).

   11) If you are upgrading to the OS/2 version of TOP, copy the included file
DRS2V5B3.DLL to any directory on your OS/2 LIBPATH.  The recommended location
for this file is the \OS2\DLL directory on your OS/2 boot partition.  If you
are upgrading to the Win95 version of TOP, copy the included ODOORS60.DLL to
your Windows SYSTEM path.  You can delete the .DLL file from the TOP directory
after copying it.

  11a) If you are upgrading to TOP for Win95 you will also need to perform the
steps described in TOPWIN95.DOC before proceeding.

  11b) If you are upgrading to TOP for OS/2 and plan to use TOP's Maximus/2
v3.0x support, please see MAXOS2V3.DOC before proceeding.

   12) Give it a try!  Logon to your BBS and run TOP as any other user normally
would.  This will ensure that your batch files work, and that the BBS will
interact with TOP properly.

   13) Be sure to read TOP.DOC for important information, including:
        - Detailed information on features and configuration.
        - How to contact the author to report problems/suggestions.

    Thank you for trying TOP!
