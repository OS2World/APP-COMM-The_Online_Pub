          **** Page 3 of 3 - Questionaire and Additional Comments ****

    Please take the time to complete the information on this page in order for
the author to ensure that TOP will suit your needs even more in the future.

    Version of TOP Used (check one):

    [   ] TOP for DOS       [   ] TOP for OS/2      [   ] TOP for Win95

    I Would Like to See a Version of TOP for (check all that apply):

    [   ] Unix              [   ] Other:  _________________________________

    BBS Software Used:  ___________________________________________________

    [   ] Check here if you would like to see TOP include support for the above
          BBS software.  The BBS software must support multiple nodes and have
          specifications and/or a developers kit freely available.

    Manual Survey (check all that apply):

    [   ] I would like to see a printed and bound manual for TOP, which would
          include a complete installation guide, tutorial, configuration and
          command reference, and troubleshooting guide.  This manual would be
          optional and available for a modest additional charge.

    [   ] Same as above, except the text of the manual should be distributed in
          a printable file with the rest of TOP, for no additional charge,
          instead of a printed and bound manual.  Note that a manual like this
          would be quite large.

    [   ] I would like to see a printed and bound language file reference for
          TOP, including a complete description of all language items, their
          usage, and the parameters used by each item.  This manual would be
          optional and available for a modest additional charge.

    [   ] Same as above, except the text of the manual should be distributed in
          a printable file with the rest of TOP, for no additional charge,
          instead of a printed and bound manual.  Note that a manual like this
          would be quite large.

    Source Code Survey:

    [   ] I would be interested in purchasing TOP's Borland C source code so I
          can customize TOP for my system's own use.

    Additional Comments or Suggestions:

    [   ] I have written additional comments and/or suggestions on the back of
          this page.
